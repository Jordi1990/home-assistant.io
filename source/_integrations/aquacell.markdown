AquaCell is a water-softening device. The [AquaCell](https://www.aquacell-waterontharder.nl/) {% term integration %} allows you to monitor your AquaCell device in Home Assistant.
You will need your Aquacell account information as used in the **AquaCell** app.

This integration also supports [Harvey](https://www.harveywatersofteners.co.uk/) softeners.

## Supported devices

This integration only works softener models which have an <b>i-Lid</b> and are configured through the 'Mijn AquaCell' or 'My Harvey' mobile app.
These models are also recognizable by the required curved salt blocks.

## Sensors

This integration provides {% term sensors %} for the following information from the AquaCell device:

- Percentage of salt remaining.
- Time remaining until 0% salt level is reached.
- i-Lid battery level.
- Wi-Fi signal strength.

## Examples

### Send a notification when your salt level is low
You can create an automation that sends a notification when the salt level is low, similar to the official app but more flexible.

### Monitor salt usage over time
You can easily plot the history of the salt level sensors over time, which can give you more insight on usage.

## Data updates
The device does not update frequently, the integration is {% term polling %} new data every day from the cloud.

## Known limitations
- No local API.

## Troubleshooting

### Canâ€™t setup the device
Make sure the device is fully setup through the official app.

## Remove integration

This integration follows standard integration removal, no extra steps are required.
